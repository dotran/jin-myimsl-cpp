.SH NAME
\fBplsesc\fP - Set the escape character for text strings 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplsesc\fP(\fIesc\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set the escape character for text strings.  From C (in contrast to fortran, see \fBplsescfortran\fP(3plplot)) you pass \fIesc\fP as a character. Only selected characters are allowed to prevent the user from shooting himself in the foot (For example, a \ isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's use of backslash as a character escape).  Here are the allowed escape
characters and their corresponding decimal ASCII values:
!, ASCII 33

#, ASCII 35

$, ASCII 36

%, ASCII 37

&, ASCII 38

*, ASCII 42

@, ASCII 64

^, ASCII 94

~, ASCII 126


.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIesc\fP (char, input)
