.SH NAME
\fBplinit\fP - Initialize PLplot 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplinit\fP()
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Initializing the plotting package.  The program prompts for the device keyword or number of the desired output device.  Hitting a RETURN in response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device.  \fBplinit\fP(3plplot) will issue no prompt if either the device was specified previously (via command line flag, the \fBplsetopt\fP(3plplot) function, or the \fBplsdev\fP(3plplot) function), or if only one device is enabled when PLplot is installed.  If subpages have been specified, the output device is divided into nx by ny subpages, each of which may be used independently.  If \fBplinit\fP(3plplot) is called again during a program, the previously opened file will be closed.  The subroutine \fBpladv\fP(3plplot) is used to advance from one subpage to the next.
