>Tcl does many things well, but handling collections of numbers is not
one of them.   You could make lists, but for data sets of sizes
relevant to scientific graphics which is the primary domain of
applicability for PLplot, the extraction time is excessive and
burdensome.  You could use Tcl arrays, but the storage overhead is
astronomical and the lookup time, while better than list manipulation,
is still prohibitive.  
</P
><P
>To cope with this, a Tcl Matrix extension was created for the
purpose of making it feasible to work with large collections of
numbers in Tcl, in a way which is storage efficient, reasonably 
efficient for accesses from Tcl, and reasonably compatible with
practices used in compiled code.

>Much like the Tk widget creation commands, the Tcl <TT

command considers its first argument to be the name of a new command
to be created, and the rest of the arguments to be modifiers.  After
the name, the next argument can be <TT
CLASS="literal"
>float</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>int</TT
> or
contractions thereof.  Next follow a variable number of size arguments
which determine the size of the matrix in each of its dimensions.  For
example:

>x</TT

dimension and 100 elements.  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>y</TT
> is an integer matrix, and has 2
dimensions each of size 64.
</P
><P

from C.  For example:
</P

>A Tcl matrix is a command, and as longtime Tcl users know, Tcl
commands are globally accessible.  The PLplot Tcl Matrix extension
attempts to lessen the impact of this by registering a variable in the
local scope, and tracing it for insets, and deleting the actual
matrix command when the variable goes out of scope.  In this way, a
Tcl matrix appears to work sort of like a variable.  It is, however,
just an illusion, so you have to keep this in mind.  In particular,
you may want the matrix to outlive the scope in which it was created.
For example, you may want to create a matrix, load it with data, and
then pass it off to a Tk megawidget for display in a spreadsheet like
form.  The proc which launches the Tk megawidget will complete, but
the megawidget, and the associated Tcl matrix are supposed to hang
around until they are explicitly destroyed.  To achieve this effect,
create the Tcl matrix with the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>-persist</TT
> flag.  If present
(can be anywhere on the line), the matrix is not automatically deleted
when the scope of the current proc (method) ends.  Instead, you must
explicitly clean up by using either the 'delete' matrix command or renaming
the matrix command name to {}.  Now works correctly from within [incr Tcl].
</P
><P
>As mentioned above, the result of creating a matrix is that a new
command of the given name is added to the interpreter.  You can then
evaluate the command, providing indices as arguments, to extract the
data.  For example:
</P

><P
>The Tcl matrix facility provides creation, indexing, and information
gathering facilities.  However, considering the scientifically
inclined PLplot user base, it is clear that some users will demand
more.  Consequently there is a mechanism for augmenting the Tcl matrix
facility with your own, user defined, extension subcommands.  Consider
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>xtk04.c</TT
>.  In this extended wish, we want to be able to
determine the minimum and maximum values stored in a matrix.  Doing
this in Tcl would involve nested loops, which in Tcl would be
prohibitively slow.  We could register a Tcl extension command to do
it, but since the only sensible data for such a command would be a
Tcl matrix, it seems nice to provide this facility as an actual
subcommand of the matrix.  However, the PLplot maintainers cannot
foresee every need, so a mechanism is provided to register subcommands
for use with matrix objects.
