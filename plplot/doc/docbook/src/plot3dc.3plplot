.SH NAME
\fBplot3dc\fP - Magnitude colored plot surface with contour. 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplot3dc\fP(\fIx\fP, \fIy\fP, \fIz\fP, \fInx\fP, \fIny\fP, \fIopt\fP, \fIclevel\fP, \fInlevel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Identical to \fBplot3d\fP but with extra functionalities: the surface mesh can be colored accordingly to the current z value being plotted, a contour plot can be drawn at the base XY plane, and a curtain can be drawn between the plotted function border and the base XY plane. The arguments are identical to \fBplmeshc\fP. The only difference between \fBplmeshc\fP(3plplot) and \fBplot3dc\fP(3plplot) is that \fBplmeshc\fP(3plplot) draws the botton side of the surface, while \fBplot3dc\fP(3plplot) only draws the surface as viewed from the top.
