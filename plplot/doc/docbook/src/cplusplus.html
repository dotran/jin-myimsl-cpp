>PLplot has long had C and Fortran bindings, presenting a fairly
conventional API to the applications programmer.  Recently (1994
onwards) PLplot has been growing interfaces (language bindings) to a
variety of other languages.  In this chapter we discuss the PLplot C++
support provided in the PLplot distribution.  Of course many other
approaches are possible, perhaps even in use by PLplot users around
the world.  The purpose of this chapter then is to explain the
rationale and intended usage for the bundled C++ language support.

>PLplot has a fairly complex C API.  There are lots of functions, and
several facilities have multiple entry points with similar names but
different argument lists.  (Think contouring, shading).  Often these
differing argument lists are to accommodate a variety of data storage
paradigms, one of which you are expected to be using!
    </P
><P
>Especially in the case of the 2-d API's for contouring and shading,
sophisticated C++ users may feel a special sense of exasperation with
the data layout prescriptions, since they are extremely primitive,
pointer rich, and prone to a wide class of memory leaks and other
sorts of programming errors.  Many C++ users know good and well that
better ways exist (templated matrix classes, etc), but historically
have not been able to use these more sophisticated techniques if the
contained data ever needed to get plotted.
    </P
><P
>Besides the 2-d API functions, there is also the multiple output
stream capability of PLplot.  Anyone who knows C++ well, and who has
used multiple output streams in PLplot, has probably noticed striking
similarities between the PLplot <TT
CLASS="literal"
>PLStream</TT
> pointer and the C++ 
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>this</TT
> pointer.  Although multiple output streams have not been 
widely used in PLplot applications in the past, the availability of
the plframe Tk widget, and the extended wish concept, is making it
much more attractive to use multiple output streams.
    </P
><P
>Unfortunately, if you do write a Tk extended wish application, and
endow your interface with multiple plframes, the event driven
character of X applications makes it difficult to ensure that PLplot
output shows up in the right plframe window.  If a plot is generated
to one plframe, the PLplot <TT
CLASS="literal"
>PLStream</TT
> pointer is directed to that
stream.  If a user then pushes a Tk button which should generate a
plot to a different plframe, the plot goes to the old plframe instead!
Schemes for controlling this can be imagined, but the logic can be
complex, especially in the face of the ability to /also/ make plots to
the same plframe from either Tcl or C++.
    </P
><P
>Beyond this, the C API is downright "ugly" for a significant number of
the functions, particularly those which return values by accepting
pointers to variables in their argument lists, and then changing them
in that way.  Sophisticated C++ users generally take considerable
pride in banishing the offensive bare pointer from their code, and
consider it disgusting to have to insert &#38;'s just in order to make a
call to an API function.
    </P
><P
>In order to address these issues (and more), I have begun constructing
a C++ interface to PLplot.  The purpose of this missive is to describe
its architecture and usage.
