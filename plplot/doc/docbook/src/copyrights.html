>      The intent behind distributing PLplot under the LGPL is to ensure
      that it continues to evolve in a positive way, while remaining freely
      distributable.  The package is considered a "library" even though
      there are associated programs, such as plrender, pltek, plserver, and
      pltcl.  The ties between these programs and the library are so great
      that I consider them as part of the library, so distribution under
      the terms of the LGPL makes sense.  Software developers are allowed
      and encouraged to use PLplot as an integral part of their product,
      even a commercial product.  Under the conditions of the LGPL,
      however, the PLplot source code must remain freely available,
      including any modifications you make to it (if you distribute a
      program based on the modified library).  Please read the full license
      for more info.
