>Each of the PLplot calls available to the C or Fortran programmer are
also available from Tcl, with the same name and generally the same
arguments.  Thus for instance, whereas in C you can write:

><TABLE

><TR

><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>plenv 0 1 0 1 0 0
pllab "(x)" "(y)" "The title of the graph"

><P
>All the normal Tcl rules apply, there is nothing special about the
PLplot extension commands.  So, you could write the above as:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>set xmin 0; set xmax 1; set ymin 0; set ymax 1
set just 0; set axis 0
set xlab (x)
set ylab (y)
set title "The title of the graph"
plenv $xmin $xmax $ymin $ymax $just $axis
pllab $xlab $ylab $title
</PRE

>for example.  Not that there is any reason to be loquacious for its
own sake, of course.  The point is that you might have things like the
plot bounds or axis labels stored in Tcl variables for some other
reason (tied to a Tk entry widget maybe, or provided as the result of
one of your application specific Tcl extension commands, etc), and
just want to use standard Tcl substitution to make the PLplot calls.
</P
><P
>Go ahead and try it!  Enter <TT
CLASS="literal"
>pltcl</TT
> to start up the PLplot
extended Tcl shell, and type (or paste) in the commands.  Or put them
in a file and source it.  By this point it should be clear how
incredibly easy it is to use the PLplot Tcl language binding.
</P
><P
>In order to accommodate the ubiquitous requirement for matrix oriented
data in scientific applications, and in the PLplot API in particular,
PLplot 5.0 includes a Tcl extension for manipulating matrices in Tcl.
This Tcl Matrix Extension provides a straightforward and direct means
of representing one and two dimensional matrices in Tcl.  The Tcl
Matrix Extension is described in detail in the next section, but we
mention its existence now just so that we can show how the PLplot Tcl
API works.  Many of the PLplot Tcl API functions accept Tcl matrices
as arguments.  For instance, in C you might write:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>float x[100], y[100];

/* code to initialize x and y */

plline( 100, x, y );
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>In Tcl you can write:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>matrix x f 100
matrix y f 100

# code to initialize x and y

plline 100 x y
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Some of the PLplot C function calls use pointer arguments to allow
retrieval of PLplot settings.  These are implemented in Tcl by
changing the value of the variable whose name you provide.  For
example:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>pltcl&#62; plgxax
wrong # args: should be "plgxax digmax digits  "
pltcl&#62; set digmax 0
0
pltcl&#62; set digits 0
0
pltcl&#62; plgxax digmax digits
pltcl&#62; puts "digmax=$digmax digits=$digits"
digmax=4 digits=0
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>This example shows that each PLplot Tcl command is designed to issue
an error if you invoke it incorrectly, which in this case was used to
remind us of the correct arguments.  We then create two Tcl variables
to hold the results.  Then we invoke the PLplot <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plgxax</TT
> function
to obtain the label formatting information for the x axis.  And
finally we print the results.
</P
><P
>People familiar with Tcl culture may wonder why the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plg*</TT
> series
functions don't just pack their results into the standard Tcl result
string.  The reason is that the user would then have to extract the
desired field with either <TT
CLASS="literal"
>lindex</TT
> or
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>regexp</TT
>, which seems
messy.  So instead, we designed the PLplot Tcl API to look and feel as
much like the C API as could reasonably be managed.
</P
><P
>In general then, you can assume that each C function is provided in
Tcl with the same name and same arguments (and one or two dimensional
arrays in C are replaced by Tcl matrices).  There are only a few
exceptions to this rule, generally resulting from the complexity of
the argument types which are passed to some functions in the C API.
Those exceptional functions are described below, all others work in
the obvious way (analogous to the examples above).  
</P
><P
>See the Tcl example programs for extensive demonstrations of the usage
of the PLplot Tcl API.  To run the Tcl demos:
</P
><TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>% pltcl
pltcl&#62; source tcldemos.tcl
pltcl&#62; 1
pltcl&#62; 2
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
><P
>Alternatively, you can run <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plserver</TT
> and source
<TT
CLASS="filename"
>tkdemos.tcl</TT
>.
</P
><P
>In any event, the Tcl demos provide very good coverage of the Tcl API,
and consequently serve as excellent examples of usage.  For the most
part they draw the same plots as their C counterpart.  Moreover, many
of them were constructed by literally inserting the C code into the
Tcl source file, and performing fairly mechanical transformations on
the source.  This should provide encouragement to anyone used to using
PLplot through one of the compiled interfaces, that they can easily
and rapidly become productive with PLplot in Tcl.
