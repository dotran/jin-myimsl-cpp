.SH NAME
\fBpladv\fP - Advance the (sub-)page
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBpladv\fP(\fIsub\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Advances to the next subpage if \fIsub\fP=0, performing a page advance if there are no remaining subpages on the current page.  If subpages aren't being used, \fBpladv\fP(3plplot)(0) will always advance the page.  If \fIsub\fP>0, PLplot switches to the specified subpage.  Note that this allows you to overwrite a plot on the specified subpage; if this is not what you intended, use \fBpleop\fP(3plplot) followed by \fBplbop\fP(3plplot) to first advance the page.  This routine is called automatically (with \fIsub\fP=0) by \fBplenv\fP(3plplot), but if \fBplenv\fP(3plplot) is not used, \fBpladv\fP(3plplot) must be called after initializing PLplot but before defining the viewport. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIsub\fP (PLINT, input) 
Specifies the subpage number (starting from 1 in the top left corner and increasing along the rows) to which to advance.  Set to zero to advance to the next subpage.
