>PLplot has historically had C and Fortran language bindings.  PLplot
version 5.0 introduces a plethora of new programming options including
C++ (described earlier) and several script language bindings.  The Tcl
interface to PLplot (which the PLplot maintainers regard as the
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"primary"</SPAN
> script language binding) is described in this chapter,
with further discussion of Tcl related issues following in additional
chapters.  But Tcl is certainly not the only script language option.
Bindings to Perl, Python, and Scheme (which is actually another
compiled language, but still has some of the flavor of a VHLL) are in
various stages of completion, and are described in separate chapters.
Use the one that suits you best--or try them all!

><P
>The recent emergence of several high quality VHLL script languages
such as Tcl, Perl, Python and arguably even some Lisp variants, is
having a profound effect upon the art of computer programming.  Tasks
which have traditionally been handled by C or Fortran, are beginning
to be seen in a new light.  With relatively fast processors now widely
available, many programming jobs are no longer bound by execution
time, but by <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"human time"</SPAN
>.  Rapidity of initial development and
continued maintenance, for a surprisingly wide class of applications,
is far more important than execution time.  Result: in a very short
period of time, say from 1993 to 1995, script languages have exploded
onto the scene, becoming essential tools for any serious programmer.
</P
><P
>Moreover, the entire concept of <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"speed of execution"</SPAN
> needs revising
in the face of the gains made in computer hardware in recent years.
Saying that script language processing is slower than compiled
language processing may be undeniable and simultaneously irrelevant.
If the script language processing is fast enough, then it is fast
enough.  Increasingly, computational researchers are finding that
script based tools are indeed fast enough.  And if their run time is
fast enough, and their development and maintenance time is much much
better, then why indeed should they not be used?
</P
><P
>Even in a field with several high visibility players, Tcl has
distinguished itself as a leading contender.  There are many reasons
for this, but perhaps the most important, at least as it relates to
the PLplot user community, is that Tcl was designed to be extensible
and embeddable.  The whole purpose of Tcl, as it name (Tool Command
Language) indicates, is to be a command language for other tools.  In
other words, the fact that Tcl is capable of being a standalone shell
is interesting, even useful, but nonetheless incidental.  The real
attraction of Tcl is that it can be the shell language for
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>your</I
></SPAN
>
code.  Tcl can easily be embedded into your code, endowing it
immediately with a full featured, consistent and well documented
script programming language, providing all the core features you need
in a programming language: variables, procedures, control structures,
error trapping and recovery, tracing, etc.  But that is only the
beginning!  After that, you can easily extend Tcl by adding commands
to the core language, which invoke the capabilities of your tool.  It
is in this sense that Tcl is a tool command language.  It is a command
language which you can augment to provide access to the facilities of
your tool.
</P
><P
>But Tcl is more than just an embeddable, extensible script language
for personal use.  Tcl is an industry, an internet phenomenon.  There
are currently at least two high quality books, with more on the way.
There is an industry of service providers and educators.  Furthermore,
literally hundreds of Tcl extensions exist, and are readily available
over the net.  Perhaps the most notable extension, Tk, provides a
fantastic interface to X Windows widget programming, permitting the
construction of Motif like user interfaces, with none of the hassles
of actually using Motif.  Some of these extensions endow Tcl with
object oriented facilities philosophically similar to C++ or other
object oriented languages.  Other extensions provide script level
access to system services.  Others provide a script interface to
sockets, RPC, and other network programming protocols.  The list goes
on and on.  Dive into the Tcl archive, and see what it has for you!
</P
><P
>So, the answer to the question <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Why do we want a Tcl interface to
PLplot?"</SPAN
> is very simple.  <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"Because we we are using Tcl anyway, as
the command language for our project, and would like to be able to do
plotting in the command language just as we do so many other things."</SPAN
>
</P
><P
>But there is more than just the aesthetics of integration to consider.
There are also significant pragmatic considerations.  If you generate
your PLplot output via function calls from a compiled language, then
in order to add new diagnostics to your code, or to refine or
embellish existing ones, you have to edit the source, recompile,
relink, and rerun the code.  If many iterations are required to get
the plot right, significant time can be wasted.  This can be
especially true in the case of C++ code making heavy use of templates,
for which many C++ compilers will have program link times measured in
minutes rather than seconds, even for trivial program changes.
</P
><P
>In contrast, if the diagnostic plot is generated from Tcl, the
development cycle looks more like: start the shell (command line or
windowing), source a Tcl script, issue the command to generate the
plot, notice a bug, edit the Tcl script, resource the script, and
regenerate the plot.   Notice that compiling, linking, and restarting
the program, have all been dropped from the development cycle.  The
time savings from such a development cycle can be amazing!
