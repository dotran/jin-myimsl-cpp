.SH NAME
\fBplfill\fP - Draw filled polygon 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplfill\fP(\fIn\fP, \fIx\fP, \fIy\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Fills the polygon defined by the \fIn\fP points (\fIx\fP[i], \fIy\fP[i]) using the pattern defined by \fBplpsty\fP(3plplot) or \fBplpat\fP(3plplot).  The routine will automatically close the polygon between the last and first vertices.  If multiple closed polygons are passed in \fIx\fP and \fIy\fP then \fBplfill\fP(3plplot) will fill in between them. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIn\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of vertices in polygon. 
.TP
\fIx\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to array with x coordinates of vertices. 
.TP
\fIy\fP (PLFLT *, input) 
Pointer to array with y coordinates of vertices.
