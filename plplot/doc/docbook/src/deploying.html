>Chapter 4. Deploying programs that use PLplot</H1
><P
>    This chapter provides some information on the issue of
    delivering programs that use PLplot: what files should be installed and
    where, what environment variables are involved and related matters.
  </P
><P
>    The scenario is this: You have created one or more programs that run
    successfully on your development machine and now you need to install
    them on the machine of a user.
  </P
><P
>    One solution is to provide him or her with the full development
    environment that you use, but that is in general only an option if your
    user is comfortable with making programs themselves. A more common
    situation is that your user just wants the executable programs and
    wants to get using them rightaway. We will focus on this particular
    solution, as there are a few non-trivial issues.
  </P
><P
>    To be absolutely clear about what we are describing, here is a summary:
    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>          Your program must run on a machine that does not have PLplot
          installed from the sources.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          There is no development environment that you can rely on.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          The program should be installed in a self-contained directory
          structure (which <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>can</I
></SPAN
> be
          <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local</TT
> or <TT
CLASS="filename"
>c:\program</TT
>
          files or whatever, but need not be so).
        </P
></LI
></UL
>
  </P
><P
>    Under Linux, the easiest way to install a binary version of PLplot on a
    user's machine is to use PLplot deb binary packages for the <A
HREF="http://www.debian.org"
TARGET="_top"
>Debian</A
> distribution, and PLplot rpm
    binary packages for rpm-based distributions. (See the <A
HREF="http://plplot.sourceforge.net/resources/index.html"
TARGET="_top"
>Resources
    area</A
> of the PLplot web site for locations of debs and rpms.)
    Build the application on the build machine using the results of the
    <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>plplot-config --cflags --libs</KBD
> command, and copy
    the resulting executable(s) to the users' machines.
  </P
><P
>    Under Unix (and also under Linux if you would prefer to use a newer
    version of PLplot than is available in the debs or rpms), a good way
    to deploy binary PLplot and applications that depend on that binary PLplot
    on users' machines is as follows:
    <P
></P
><UL
><LI
><P
>	  Use the <B
CLASS="command"
>./configure</B
> option
	  <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>--prefix=/usr/local/plplot</KBD
> (or some other
	  unique but consistent directory that is available on the build
	  machine and all users' machines).
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Build and install as normal on the build machine.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Copy the installed PLplot tree,
	  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local/plplot</TT
>, into a tarball.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Unpack that tarball on all users' machines in the same location
	  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local/plplot</TT
>.
        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>	  Build the application(s) on the build machine using the results
	  of the <KBD
CLASS="userinput"
>plplot-config --cflags --libs</KBD
>
	  command, and copy the resulting executable(s) to the users'
	  machines.  Since the PLplot install location is consistent on all
	  machines, the application should work the same way on all
	  machines.
        </P
></LI
></UL
>
  </P
><P
>    On Windows, and also those rare Linux/Unix cases where you cannot install
    the PLplot install tree in a consistent location on users' machines, then
    there are some additional options you need to consider.
  </P

    require another environment variable so the PLplot shared libraries can
    be found at run time by the run-time loader.  The details depend on the
    system you are working on, but here are some common platforms:
    <P

><UL
><LI
><P
>          Most UNIX, BSD and Linux systems use an environment variable
          <CODE
CLASS="envar"

          directories where shared libraries can be found. Some use
          <CODE

        </P
></LI
><LI
><P
>          On Windows the PATH variable is used to find the DLLs, but
          beware: Windows uses a number of places to find the DLLs a
          program needs and the ordering seems to depend on some intricate
          details. It seems easiest and safest to put the DLLs in the same
          directory as your program.

  </P
><P
>    When PLplot uses dynamic devices, it first builds up a list of them, by
    examining a directory which contains files describing those devices:
    the <TT
CLASS="filename"
>*.rc</TT
> files. Each of these files indicates what
    the relevant properties for the device or devices. Then when the
    device is actually needed, the corresponding shared object (or plug-in
    or DLL depending on your terminology) is dynamically loaded.
  </P
><P
>    The directory that contains all these files (the device descriptions as
    well as the actual libraries and the description files that libtool
    uses) is a directory determined at the time you configured
    PLplot which is typically something like
    <TT
CLASS="filename"
>/usr/local/plplot/lib/plplot5.3.1/driversd</TT
>.  This
    directory must be pointed to by the <CODE
CLASS="envar"
>PLPLOT_DRV_DIR</CODE
>
    environment variable. Again for deployment, only the environment
    variable is of real interest.
