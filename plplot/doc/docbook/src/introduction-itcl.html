>      Another extremely powerful and popular extension to Tcl is [incr
      Tcl].  [incr Tcl] is to Tcl what C++ is to C.  The analogy is very
      extensive.  Itcl provides an object oriented extension to Tcl
      supporting clustering of procedures and data into what is called an
      <TT
CLASS="literal"
>itcl_class</TT
>.  An <TT
CLASS="literal"
>itcl_class</TT
> can
      have methods as well as instance data.  And they support inheritance.
      Essentially if you know how C++ relates to C, and if you know Tcl,
      then you understand the programming model provided by Itcl.
    </P
><P
>      In particular, you can use Itcl to implement new widgets which are
      composed of more basic Tk widgets.  A file selector is an example.
      Using Tk, one can build up a very nice file selector comprised of
      more basic Tk widgets such as entries, listboxes, scrollbars, etc.
    </P
><P
>      But what if you need two file selectors?  You have to do it all
      again.  Or what if you need two different kinds of file selectors,
      you get to do it again and add some incremental code.
    </P
><P
>      This is exactly the sort of thing object orientation is intended to
      assist.  Using Itcl you can create an <TT
CLASS="literal"
>itcl_class
	FileSelector</TT
> and then you can instantiate them freely as
      easily as:

    </P

>      These high level widgets composed of smaller Tk widgets, are known as
      <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"megawidgets"</SPAN
>.  There is a developing subculture of the
      Tcl/Tk community for designing and implementing megawidgets, and
      [incr Tcl] is the most popular enabling technology.

      the construction of the PLplot Tcl extensions, described below.
