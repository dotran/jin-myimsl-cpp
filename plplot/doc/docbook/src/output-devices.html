>PLplot supports a variety of output devices, via a set of device drivers.
Each driver is required to emulate a small set of low-level graphics
primitives such as initialization, line draw and page advance, as well
as be completely independent of the PLplot package as a whole.  Thus a
driver may be very simple, as in the case of the many black and white file
drivers (tektronix, etc.).  More complicated and/or color systems require a
bit more effort by the driver, with the most effort required by an output
device with a graphical user interface, including menus for screen dumps,
palette manipulation, and so forth.  At present only the tk driver does
the latter on Unix systems.  At present we aren't pursuing
a Macintosh development effort due to a lack of time and expertise, but
will assist anyone wanting to volunteer for the job.
</P
><P
> Note that if you always render to a PLplot metafile, you can always
<CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
> them to new devices as they become available.
</P
><P
>The list of available devices presented when starting PLplot (via
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>plstar</TT
>) is determined at compile time.  When installing PLplot you may wish
to exclude devices not available on your system in order to reduce screen
clutter.  To include a specified device, simply define the appropriate macro
constant when building PLplot (see the installation instructions for your
system).

Notes: Most devices allow multi-page plots to be stored in a single graphics
file, in which case the graphics file should be opened in the pl_init()
routine, closed in pl_tidy(), and page advances done by calling pl_eop and
pl_bop() in sequence. If multi-page plots need to be stored in different
files then pl_bop() should open the file and pl_eop() should close it.  Do
NOT open files in both pl_init() and pl_bop() or close files in both
pl_eop() and pl_tidy(). It is recommended that when adding new functions to
only a certain driver, the escape function be used.  Otherwise it is
necessary to add a null routine to all the other drivers to handle the new
function.

>The PLplot metafile is a way to store and transport your graphical data for
rendering at a later time or on a different system.  A PLplot metafile is
in binary format in order to speed access and keep storage costs
reasonable.  All data is stored in device-independent format (written as a
stream of bytes); the resulting file is about as portable as a tektronix
vector graphics file and only slightly larger. 
</P
><P
>Each PLplot metafile begins with a header string that identifies it as
such, as well as the version number of the format since
this may change in time.  The utility for rendering the metafile,
<CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
>, verifies that the input file is indeed a valid PLplot metafile,
and that it <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"understands"</SPAN
> the format the metafile is written in.
<CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
> is part of the PLplot package and should be built at the time of
building PLplot, and then put into your search path.  It is capable of 
high speed rendering of the graphics file, especially if the output device
can accept commands at a high rate (e.g. X windows).

Each command is written as a single byte, possibly followed by
additional data bytes.  The <TT
CLASS="literal"
>NEW_COLOR</TT
> and
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>NEW_WIDTH</TT
> commands each write 2 data bytes, the
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>LINETO</TT
> command writes 4 data bytes, and the
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>LINE</TT
> command writes 8 data bytes.  The most common
instruction in the typical metafile will be the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>LINETO</TT
>
command, which draws a continuation of the previous line to the given point.
This data encoding is not quite as efficient as the tektronix format, which
uses 4 bytes instead of 5 here (1 command <TT
CLASS="literal"
>+</TT
> 4 data),
however the PLplot encoding is far simpler to implement and more robust. The
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>ESCAPE</TT
> function writes a second command character
(opcode) followed by an arbitrary number of data bytes depending on the
value of the opcode. Note that any data written must be in device
independent form to maintain the transportability of the metafile so
floating point numbers are not allowed.

out more about the graphics file being written.  In particular, by
periodically checking the number of the member file currently being written
to, one can detect when a new member file is started.  This information
might be used in various ways; for example you could spawn a process to
automatically plrender each metafile after it is closed (perhaps during a
long simulation run) and send it off to be printed. 
</P
><P
> <CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
> has several options for dealing with
family files.  It can process a single member file
(<CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
>  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>test.plm.1</TT
>)
or the entire family if given only the stem name
(<CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
>  <TT
CLASS="filename"
>test.plm</TT
>)
It can also create family files on output, rendering to any
device that supports familying, including another metafile if desired.  The
size of member files in this case is input through the argument list, and
defaults to 1MB if unspecified (this may be changed during the PLplot
installation, however). <CODE
CLASS="function"
>plrender</CODE
> can also create a
single output file from a familied input metafile. </P

devices.  
</P
><P
>Many popular terminals or terminal emulators at present have a
facility for switching between text and graphics <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"screens"</SPAN
>.
This includes the xterm emulator under X-windows, vt100's with
Retrographics, and numerous emulators for microcomputers which have a dual
vt100/tek4010 emulation capability.  On these devices, it is possible to
switch between the text and graphics screens by surrounding your PLplot
calls by calls to <A
HREF="plgra.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plgra</CODE
></A
> and <A
HREF="pltext.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>pltext</CODE
></A
>.  This will allow your diagnostic and
informational code output to not interfere with your graphical output.
</P
><P
>At present, only the xterm driver supports switching between text
and graphics screens.  The escape sequences as sent by the xterm driver
are fairly standard, however, and have worked correctly on most other
popular vt100/tek4010 emulators we've tried.
</P
><P
>When using the xterm driver, hitting a RETURN will advance and clear the
page.  If indeed running from an xterm, you may resize, move, cover and
uncover the window.  The behavior of the X-window driver is quite different,
however.  First, it is much faster, as there is no tty-like handshaking
going on.  Second, a mouse click is used to advance and clear the page,
rather than a RETURN.

      graphs on a page, but all subpages are constrained to be of the same

	<A

	subpage.  The screen is cleared (or a new piece of paper loaded) if a
	new subpage is requested when there are no subpages left on the
	current page.  When a page is divided into subpages, the default
	character, symbol and tick sizes are scaled inversely as the square
	root of the number of subpages in the vertical direction.  This is
	designed to improve readability of plot labels as the plot size
	shrinks.

>      PLplot has the ability to write to multiple output streams.  An
      output stream corresponds to a single logical device to which one
      plots independent of all other streams.  The function <A
HREF="plsstrm.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plsstrm</CODE
></A
> is
      used to switch between streams -- you may only write to one output
      stream at a time.  At present, an output stream is not limited by the
      type of device, however, it may not be wise to attempt opening two
      terminal devices.  An example usage for the creation of multiple
      streams is as follows:
    </P
><P
>      <TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>#include "plplot.h"

main()
{
    int nx = 2, ny = 2;

    plssub(nx, ny);
    plsdev("xwin");
    plinit();

    &#60;plots for stream 0&#62;

    plsstrm(1);
    plssub(nx, ny);
    plsdev("plmeta");
    plsfnam("tst.plm");
    plinit();

    &#60;plots for stream 1&#62;

    plsstrm(0);

    &#60;plots for stream 0&#62;</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
    </P
><P
>      and so on, for sending output simultaneously to an X-window and a
      metafile.  The default stream corresponds to stream number zero.  At
      present, the majority of output drivers can only be used by a single
      stream (exceptions include the metafile driver and X-window driver).
      Also see example program 14 (note: only the C version is available,
      although it can be done equally well from Fortran).
    </P
><P
>      At the end of a plotting program, it is important to close the
      plotting device by calling <A
HREF="plend.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plend</CODE
></A
>.  This flushes any internal
      buffers and frees any memory that may have been allocated, for all
      open output streams.  You may call <A
HREF="plend1.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plend1</CODE
></A
> to close the plotting
      device for the current output stream only.  Note that if PLplot is
      initialized more than once during a program to change the output
      device, an automatic call to <A

><CODE

      is opened for the given stream.
