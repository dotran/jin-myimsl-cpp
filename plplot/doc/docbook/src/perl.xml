  <title>Using PLplot from Perl</title>
  <para>
    There are no proper bindings for the Perl language delivered with the
    PLplot sources.  However, a PLplot interface has been added to the Perl
    Data Language (PDL) since version 2.4.0.  If the PLplot library is
    installed in the system, it is automatically detected by the PDL
    configuration script, such that PLplot support for PDL should work out
    of the box.  For further informations see the <ulink
    url="http://pdl.perl.org">PDL homepage</ulink>.  Here is an usage
    example:
  </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
use PDL;
use PDL::Graphics::PLplot;

$x = pdl (0..5);
$y = $x ** 2;

plsdev ("xwin");
plinit ();
plcol0 (1);

plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
plline ($x, $y);

plend ();
    </programlisting>
  </para>

  <para>
    There is also a Perl PLplot interface on <ulink
    url="http://www.cpan.org">CPAN</ulink> which is not dependent on PDL.
    The Perl module is called <ulink
    url="http://search.cpan.org/%7Etjenness/">Graphics::PLplot</ulink> and is
    appropriate for small data arrays.  The API is very similar to the C
    API except that if the number of elements in an array is required by
    the C function the perl interface calculates it automatically.  Also,
    return values are returned and not supplied as arguments.  Here is the
    PDL example above translated to Graphics::PLplot:
  </para>

    <para>
      <programlisting>
use Graphics::PLplot qw/ :all /;

@x = (0..5);
@y = map {$_ * $_} @x;

plsdev ("xwin");
plinit ();
plcol0 (1);

plenv (-0.5, 5.5, -1, 26, 0, 0);
plline (\@x, \@y);

plend ();
      </programlisting>
    </para>
