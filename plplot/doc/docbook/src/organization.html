>      The PLplot library has been designed so that it is easy to write
      programs producing graphical output without having to set up large
      numbers of parameters.  However, more precise control of the results
      may be necessary, and these are accommodated by providing lower-level
      routines which change the system defaults.  The manual first describes
      the overall process of producing a graph using the high-level
      routines (see <A
HREF="simple.html#simple-graph"
>the Section called <I
>Plotting a Simple Graph</I
> in Chapter 2</A
>).  For a discussion of
      the underlying concepts of the plotting process and an introduction
      to some of the more complex routines (see <A
HREF="advanced.html"
>Chapter 3</A
>).
      An alphabetical list of the user-accessible PLplot functions with
      detailed descriptions is given in the reference section of the manual
      (see <A
HREF="api.html"
>Chapter 16</A
>).
    </P
><P
>      Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used
      in the description of each PLplot function.  The C and Fortran
      language interfaces are discussed in Appendix \ref{ap:lang}; look
      there if you have difficulty interpreting the call syntax as
      described in this manual.  The meaning of function (subroutine)
      arguments is typically the same regardless of whether you are calling
      from C or Fortran (but there are some exceptions to this).  The
      arguments for each function are usually specified in terms of PLFLT
      and PLINT&#8212;these are the internal PLplot representations for
      integer and floating point, and are typically a long and a float (or
      an INTEGER and a REAL, for Fortran programmers).  See Appendix
      \ref{ap:lang} for more detail.
    </P

>      Also, you can use PLplot from C++ just as you would from C.  No
      special classes are available at this time, just use it as any other
      procedural type library.  Simply include
      <TT
CLASS="filename"
>plplot.h</TT
>, and invoke as you would from C.
    </P

>      The output devices supported by PLplot are listed in Appendix
      \ref{ap:dev}, along with description of the device driver--PLplot
      interface, metafile output, family files, and vt100/tek4010
      emulators.  In Appendix\ref{ap:sys} the usage and installation for
      each system supported by PLplot is described (not guaranteed to be
      entirely up-to-date; check the release notes to be sure).
