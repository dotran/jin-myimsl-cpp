.SH NAME
\fBplscol0\fP -  Set a given color from color map0 by 8
bit RGB value 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplscol0\fP(\fIicol0\fP, \fIr\fP, \fIg\fP, \fIb\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Set a given color by 8-bit RGB value for color map0 (see the PLplot documentation).  Overwrites the previous color value for the given index and, thus, does not result in any additional allocation of space for colors. 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fIicol0\fP (PLINT, input) 
Color index.  Must be less than the maximum number of colors (which is set by default, by \fBplscmap0n\fP(3plplot), or even by \fBplscmap0\fP(3plplot)). 
.TP
\fIr\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of red in the color. 
.TP
\fIg\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of green in the color. 
.TP
\fIb\fP (PLINT, input) 
Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the degree of blue in the color.
