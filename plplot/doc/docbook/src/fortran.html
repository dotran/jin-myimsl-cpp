>As discussed in the preceding section, PLplot's integer representation is a
PLINT and its floating point representation is a PLFLT.  To the
Fortran user, this most commonly translates to a type
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>integer</TT
> and
type <TT
CLASS="literal"
>real</TT
>, respectively.  This is somewhat system dependent (and up to
the installer of the package) so you should check the release notes to be
sure, or just try it and see what happens.
  </P
><P
>Because the PLplot kernel is written in C, standard C syntax is used in the
description of each PLplot function.  Thus to understand this manual it is
helpful to know a little about C, but fortunately the translation is very
easy and can be summarized here.  As an example, the routine 
<A
HREF="plline.html"
><CODE
CLASS="function"
>plline</CODE
></A
> call from C would look like:
<TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>	plline(n,x,y);
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
while from Fortran it would look like:
<TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>	call plline(n,x,y)
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE

typically with <TT
CLASS="literal"
>n</TT
> declared as type
<TT
CLASS="literal"
>integer</TT
> and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>x</TT

CLASS="literal"
>y</TT
>
declared as type <TT
CLASS="literal"
>real</TT

In C there are two ways to pass a variable --- by value (the default) or by
reference (pointer), whereas only the latter is used by Fortran.
Therefore when you see references in the text to <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>either</I
></SPAN
> an ordinary
argument or a pointer argument (e.g.  <TT
CLASS="literal"
>*data</TT
>), you simply use an
ordinary Fortran variable or array name.
  </P
><P
>The PLplot library comes with a set of Fortran interface routines that
allow the exact same call syntax (usually) regardless of whether calling
from C or Fortran.  In some cases, this means the subroutine name <SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>exceeds 8 characters in length</I
></SPAN
>.  Nearly every Fortran compiler
available
today allows subroutine names longer than 8 characters, so this should not
be a problem (although if it ever is, in principle a truncated name could
be defined for that platform).
  </P
><P
>These <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"stub"</SPAN
> routines handle transforming the data
from the normal Fortran representation to that typically used in C.  This
includes:
<P

><UL
><LI
><P
>Variables passed by value instead of by reference.
  </P
><P
>Fortran passes all subroutine arguments by reference, i.e., a pointer to the
argument value is pushed on the stack.  In C all values, except for arrays
(including char arrays), are passed by value, i.e., the argument value
itself is pushed on the stack.  The stub routine converts the Fortran call
by reference to a call by value.  As an example, here is how the plpoin stub
routine works.  In your Fortran program you might have a call to plpoin that
looks something like
<TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>      call plpoin(6,x,y,9)
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
where x and y are arrays with 6 elements and you want to plot symbol 9.
As strange as it seems (at least to C programmers) the constants 6 and
9 are passed by reference.   This will actually call the following C
stub routine (included in entirety)
<TABLE
CLASS="verbatim"
><TR
><TD
><PRE
CLASS="programlisting"
>#include "plplot/plstubs.h"

void 
PLPOIN(n, x, y, code)
PLINT *n, *code;
PLFLT *x, *y;
{
    c_plpoin(*n, x, y, *code);
}
</PRE
></TD
></TR
></TABLE
>
All this stub routine does is convert the number of points
(<TT
CLASS="literal"
>*n</TT
> and the
symbol <TT
CLASS="literal"
>*code</TT
> to call by value (i.e.  pushes their value on the stack)
and then calls the C plpoin library routine.
</P
></LI
><LI
><P
>Get mapping between Fortran and C namespace right (system dependent).
  </P
><P
>The external symbols (i.e. function and subroutine names) as you see them
in your program often appear differently to the linker.  For example, the
Fortran routine names may be converted to uppercase or lowercase, and/or
have an underscore appended or prepended.  This translation is handled
entirely via redefinition of the stub routine names, which are macros.
There are several options for compiling PLplot that simplify getting the
name translation right (NEEDS DOCUMENTATION IF THESE STILL EXIST).  In any
case, once the name translation is established during installation, name
translation is completely transparent to the user.

><P
>Translation of character string format from Fortran to C.
  </P
><P
>Fortran character strings are passed differently than other quantities, in
that a string descriptor is pushed on the stack along with the string
address.  C doesn't want the descriptor, it wants a NULL terminated string.
For routines that handle strings two stub routines are necessary, one
written in Fortran and one written in C.  Your Fortran program calls the
Fortran stub routine first.  This stub converts the character string to a
null terminated integer array and then calls the C stub routine.  The C
stub routine converts the integer array (type <TT
CLASS="literal"
>long</TT
>) to the usual C
string representation (which may be different, depending on whether your
machine uses a big endian or little endian byte ordering; in any case the
way it is done in PLplot is portable).  See the <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plmtex</TT
> stubs for an
example of this. 
  </P
><P
>Note that the portion of a Fortran character string that exceeds 299
characters will not be plotted by the text routines (<TT
CLASS="literal"
>plmtex</TT
>
and <TT
CLASS="literal"
>plptex</TT
>).

><P
>Multidimensional array arguments are changed from row-dominant to
column-dominant ordering through use of a temporary array.
  </P
><P
>In Fortran, arrays are always stored so that the first index increases most
rapidly as one steps through memory.  This is called
<SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"row-dominant"</SPAN
>
storage.  In C, on the other hand, the first index increases 
<SPAN
CLASS="emphasis"
><I
CLASS="emphasis"
>least</I
></SPAN
>
rapidly, i.e. <SPAN
CLASS="QUOTE"
>"column-dominant"</SPAN
> ordering.  Thus, two dimensional arrays
(e.g.  as passed to the contour or surface plotting routines) passed into
PLplot must be transposed in order to get the proper two-dimensional
relationship to the world coordinates.  This is handled in the C stub
routines by dynamic memory allocation of a temporary array.  This is then set
equal to the transpose of the passed in array and passed to the appropriate
PLplot routine.  The overhead associated with this is normally not important
but could be a factor if you are using very large 2d arrays.
</P

  </P
><P
>This all seems a little messy, but is very user friendly.  Fortran and C
programmers can use the same basic interface to the library, which is a
powerful plus for this method.  The fact that stub routines are being used
is completely transparent to the Fortran programmer.
