.SH NAME
\fBplpat\fP - Set area fill pattern 
.SH SYNOPSIS
\fBplpat\fP(\fInlin\fP, \fIinc\fP, \fIdel\fP)
.SH DESCRIPTION

.P
Sets the area fill pattern.  The pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of parallel lines with specified inclinations and spacings.  The arguments to this routine are the number of sets to use (1 or 2) followed by two pointers to integer arrays (of 1 or 2 elements) specifying the inclinations in tenths of a degree and the spacing in micrometers.  (also see \fBplpsty\fP(3plplot)) 
.SH ARGUMENTS
.TP
\fInlin\fP (PLINT, input) 
Number of sets of lines making up the pattern, either 1 or 2. 
.TP
\fIinc\fP (PLINT *, input) 
Pointer to array with \fInlin\fP elements. Specifies the line inclination in tenths of a degree.  (Should be between -900 and 900). 
.TP
\fIdel\fP (PLINT *, input) 
Pointer to array with \fInlin\fP elements. Specifies the spacing in micrometers between the lines making up the pattern.
