.I "file"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR plpr ,
command.
.PP
.B plpr
Takes the named metafile and converts it to something your printer
will understand.  This will be improved later to handle multiple
printers and printer settings.  Only intended for use from the
plplot/TK driver!  It deletes the named metafile after converting to
the proper type so this is not suitable for general use.
