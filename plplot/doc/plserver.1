.SH SYNOPSIS
.B plserver 
.I "[args]"
.SH "DESCRIPTION"
This manual page documents briefly the
.BR plserver ,
command.
.PP
.B plserver
is just a front-end to the pltkMain() function.  Structured along the
preferred lines for extended wish'es.  It typically runs as a child
process from the PLplot TK driver to render output.  Can use either TK
send or Tcl-DP RPC for communication, depending on how it is invoked.
.PP
Note that plserver can be used the same way as wish or dpwish, as it
contains the functionality of each of these (except the -notk Tcl-DP
command-line option is not supported).
