# This flag only required for top-level Makefile.am.  
# It insures you only have to run cf/bootstrap.sh once on the first
# clean install.  After that, aclocal (and automake, autoconf, and 
# ./configure) called automatically whenever required by a change to 
# configure.ac or any file in the cf subdirectory.

# The above is an inspired hack which may not work indefinitely.  
# Return to simpler more reliable form below as soon as 
# automake-1.8 underquoted warning messages quit being such an annoyance.
