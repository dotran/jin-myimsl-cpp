This file briefly describes how to add PLplot API to Tcl.

The two important files are plapi.tpl (for simple wrappers for the PLplot
API) and tclAPI.c (for more complicated cases).  Add additional API by
editing these files appropriately using other APIs defined within these
files as a guide.  If plapi.tpl has been changed, then the Makefile
generates the files tclgen.c, tclgen.h, tclgen_s.h using the command

perl pltclgen

tclAPI.c includes the generated files tclgen.c, tclgen.h, tclgen_s.h
where appropriate and also adds additional more complicated API as required
to define the overall PLplot API for Tcl.
