plsesc: Set the escape character for text strings 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set the escape character for text strings.	From C (in contrast to
    fortran, see plsescfortran) you pass esc as a character. Only selected
    characters are allowed to prevent the user from shooting himself in
    the foot (For example, a \ isn't allowed since it conflicts with C's
    use of backslash as a character escape).  Here are the allowed escape
    characters and their corresponding decimal ASCII values:
    !, ASCII 33     #, ASCII 35     $, ASCII 36     %, ASCII 37     &,
    ASCII 38	 *, ASCII 42	 @, ASCII 64	 ^, ASCII 94	 ~, ASCII
    126

SYNOPSIS:

plsesc(esc)

ARGUMENTS:

    esc (char, input) :    Escape character.
