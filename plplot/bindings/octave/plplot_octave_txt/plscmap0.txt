plscmap0: Set color map0 colors by 8-bit RGB
values 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set color map0 colors using 8-bit RGB values (see the PLplot
    documentation).  This sets the entire color map -- only as many colors
    as specified will be allocated. 

SYNOPSIS:

plscmap0(r, g, b, ncol0)

ARGUMENTS:

    r (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of red in the color. 

    g (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of green in the color. 

    b (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of blue in the color. 

    ncol0 (PLINT, input) :    Number of items in the r, g, and b arrays.
