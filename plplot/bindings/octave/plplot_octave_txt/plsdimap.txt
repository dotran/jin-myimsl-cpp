plsdimap: Set up transformation from metafile
coordinates 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set up transformation from metafile coordinates.  The size of the plot
    is scaled so as to preserve aspect ratio.  This isn't intended to be a
    general-purpose facility just yet (not sure why the user would need
    it, for one). 

SYNOPSIS:

plsdimap(dimxmin, dimxmax, dimymin, dimymax, dimxpmm, dimypmm)

ARGUMENTS:

    dimxmin (PLINT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION 

    dimxmax (PLINT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION 

    dimymin (PLINT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION 

    dimymax (PLINT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION 

    dimxpmm (PLFLT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION 

    dimypmm (PLFLT, input) :    NEEDS DOCUMENTATION
