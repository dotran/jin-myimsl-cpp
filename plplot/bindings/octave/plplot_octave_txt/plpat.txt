plpat: Set area fill pattern 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets the area fill pattern.  The pattern consists of 1 or 2 sets of
    parallel lines with specified inclinations and spacings.  The
    arguments to this routine are the number of sets to use (1 or 2)
    followed by two pointers to integer arrays (of 1 or 2 elements)
    specifying the inclinations in tenths of a degree and the spacing in
    micrometers.  (also see plpsty) 

SYNOPSIS:

plpat(nlin, inc, del)

ARGUMENTS:

    nlin (PLINT, input) :    Number of sets of lines making up the
    pattern, either 1 or 2. 

    inc (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with nlin elements.
    Specifies the line inclination in tenths of a degree.  (Should be
    between -900 and 900). 

    del (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with nlin elements.
    Specifies the spacing in micrometers between the lines making up
    the pattern.
