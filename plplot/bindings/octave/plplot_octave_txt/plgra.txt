plgra: Switch to graphics screen 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets an interactive device to graphics mode, used in conjunction with
    pltext to allow graphics and text to be interspersed.  On a device
    which supports separate text and graphics windows, this command causes
    control to be switched to the graphics window.  If already in graphics
    mode, this command is ignored.  It is also ignored on devices which
    only support a single window or use a different method for shifting
    focus.  See also pltext.
