plstar: Initialization 

DESCRIPTION:

    Initializing the plotting package.	The program prompts for the device
    keyword or number of the desired output device.  Hitting a RETURN in
    response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device.  If
    only one device is enabled when PLplot is installed, plstar will issue
    no prompt.	The output device is divided into nx by ny subpages, each
    of which may be used independently.  The subroutine pladv is used to
    advance from one subpage to the next. 

SYNOPSIS:

plstar(nx, ny)

ARGUMENTS:

    nx (PLINT, input) :    Number of subpages to divide output page in the
    horizontal direction. 

    ny (PLINT, input) :    Number of subpages to divide output page in the
    vertical direction.
