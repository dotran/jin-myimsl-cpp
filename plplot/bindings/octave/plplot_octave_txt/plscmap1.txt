plscmap1: Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB
values 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set color map1 colors using 8-bit RGB values (see the PLplot
    documentation).  This also sets the number of colors. 

SYNOPSIS:

plscmap1(r, g, b, ncol1)

ARGUMENTS:

    r (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of red in the color. 

    g (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of green in the color. 

    b (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with set of unsigned 8-bit
    integers (0-255) representing the degree of blue in the color. 

    ncol1 (PLINT, input) :    Number of items in the r, g, and b arrays.
