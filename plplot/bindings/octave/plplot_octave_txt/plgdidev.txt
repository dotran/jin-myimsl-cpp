DESCRIPTION:

    Get relative margin width, aspect ratio, and relative justification
    that define current device-space window. If plsdidev has not been
    called the default values pointed to by p_mar, p_aspect, p_jx, and
    p_jy will all be 0. 

SYNOPSIS:

plgdidev(p_mar, p_aspect, p_jx, p_jy)

ARGUMENTS:

    p_mar (PLFLT *, output) :     Pointer to relative margin width. 

    p_aspect (PLFLT *, output) :    Pointer to aspect ratio. 

    p_jx (PLFLT *, output) :    Pointer to relative justification in x. 

    p_jy (PLFLT *, output) :    Pointer to relative justification in y.
