pltext: Switch to text screen 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets an interactive device to text mode, used in conjunction with
    plgra to allow graphics and text to be interspersed.  On a device
    which supports separate text and graphics windows, this command causes
    control to be switched to the text window.	This can be useful for
    printing diagnostic messages or getting user input, which would
    otherwise interfere with the plots.  The program must switch back to
    the graphics window before issuing plot commands, as the text (or
    console) device will probably become quite confused otherwise.  If
    already in text mode, this command is ignored.  It is also ignored on
    devices which only support a single window or use a different method
    for shifting focus (see also plgra). 

SYNOPSIS:
