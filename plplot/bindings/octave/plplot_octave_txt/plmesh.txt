plmesh: Plot surface mesh 

DESCRIPTION:

    Plots a surface mesh within the environment set up by plw3d.  The
    surface is defined by the two-dimensional array z[
    nx][
    ny], the point z[i][j] being the value of the function at (
    x[i], 
    y[j]).  Note that the points in arrays x and y do not need to be
    equally spaced, but must be stored in ascending order.  The parameter
    opt controls the way in which the surface is displayed.  For further
    details see the PLplot documentation. 

SYNOPSIS:

plmesh(x, y, z, nx, ny, opt)

ARGUMENTS:

    x (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to set of x coordinate values at which
    the function is evaluated. 

    y (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to set of y coordinate values at which
    the function is evaluated. 

    z (PLFLT **, input) :    Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array
    with set of function values. 

    nx (PLINT, input) :    Number of x values at which function is
    evaluated. 

    ny (PLINT, input) :    Number of y values at which function is
    evaluated. 

    opt (PLINT, input) :    Determines the way in which the surface is
    represented: opt=DRAW_LINEX: Lines are drawn showing z as a
    function of x for each value of y[j]. 
        opt=DRAW_LINEY: Lines are drawn showing z as a function of y
        for each value of x[i]. 
        opt=DRAW_LINEXY: Network of lines is drawn connecting points
        at which function is defined.
