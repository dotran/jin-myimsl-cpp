plscmap1n: Set number of colors in color map1 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set number of colors in color map1, (re-)allocate color map1, and set
    default values if this is the first allocation (see the PLplot
    documentation). 

SYNOPSIS:

plscmap1n(ncol1)

ARGUMENTS:

    ncol1 (PLINT, input) :    Number of colors that will be allocated in
    the map1 palette. If this number is zero or less, then the value
    from the previous call to plscmap1n is used and if there is no
    previous call, then a default value is used.
