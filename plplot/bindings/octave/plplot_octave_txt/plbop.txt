plbop: Begin a new page

DESCRIPTION:

    Begins a new page.	For a file driver, the output file is opened if
    necessary.	Advancing the page via pleop and plbop is useful when a
    page break is desired at a particular point when plotting to subpages.
     Another use for pleop and plbop is when plotting pages to different
    files, since you can manually set the file name by calling plsfnam
    after the call to pleop. (In fact some drivers may only support a
    single page per file, making this a necessity.)  One way to handle
    this case automatically is to page advance via pladv, but enable
    familying (see plsfam) with a small limit on the file size so that a
    new family member file will be created on each page break.
