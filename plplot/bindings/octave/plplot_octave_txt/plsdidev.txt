plsdidev: Set parameters that define current device-space window 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set relative margin width, aspect ratio, and relative justification
    that define current device-space window.  If you want to just use the
    previous value for any of these, just pass in the magic value
    PL_NOTSET. It is unlikely that one should ever need to change the
    aspect ratio but it's in there for completeness. If plsdidev is not
    called the default values of mar, jx, and jy are all 0. aspect is set
    to a device-specific value. 

SYNOPSIS:

plsdidev(mar, aspect, jx, jy)

ARGUMENTS:

    mar (PLFLT, input) :    Relative margin width. 

    aspect (PLFLT, input) :    Aspect ratio. 

    jx (PLFLT, input) :    Relative justification in x. 

    jy (PLFLT, input) :    Relative justification in y.
