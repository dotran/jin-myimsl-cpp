plstart: Initialization 

DESCRIPTION:

    Alternative to plstar for initializing the plotting package.  The
    device name keyword for the desired output device must be supplied as
    an argument.  The device keywords are the same as those printed out by
    plstar.  If the requested device is not available, or if the input
    string is empty or begins with ``?'', the prompted startup of plstar
    is used.  This routine also divides the output device into nx by ny
    subpages, each of which may be used independently.	The subroutine
    pladv is used to advance from one subpage to the next. 

SYNOPSIS:

plstart(device, nx, ny)

ARGUMENTS:

    device (const char *, input) :    Device name (keyword) of the
    required output device.  If NULL or if the first character is a
    ``?'', the normal (prompted) startup is used. 

    nx (PLINT, input) :    Number of subpages to divide output page in the
    horizontal direction. 

    ny (PLINT, input) :    Number of subpages to divide output page in the
    vertical direction.
