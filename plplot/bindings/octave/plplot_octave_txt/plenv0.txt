plenv0: Same as plenv but if in multiplot mode does not advance the subpage, instead clears it. 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets up plotter environment for simple graphs by calling pladv and
    setting up viewport and window to sensible default values.	plenv0
    leaves enough room around most graphs for axis labels and a title.
    When these defaults are not suitable, use the individual routines
    plvpas, plvpor, or plvasp for setting up the viewport, plwind for
    defining the window, and plbox for drawing the box. 

SYNOPSIS:

plenv0(xmin, xmax, ymin, ymax, just, axis)

ARGUMENTS:

    xmin (PLFLT, input) :    Value of x at left-hand edge of window (in
    world coordinates). 

    xmax (PLFLT, input) :    Value of x at right-hand edge of window (in
    world coordinates). 

    ymin (PLFLT, input) :    Value of y at bottom edge of window (in world
    coordinates). 

    ymax (PLFLT, input) :    Value of y at top edge of window (in world
    coordinates). 

    just (PLINT, input) :    Controls how the axes will be scaled: -1: the
    scales will not be set, the user must set up the scale before
    calling plenv0 using plsvpa, plvasp or other. 
        0: the x and y axes are scaled independently to use as much of
        the screen as possible. 
        1: the scales of the x and y axes are made equal. 
        2: the axis of the x and y axes are made equal, and the plot
        box will be square. 


    axis (PLINT, input) :    Controls drawing of the box around the plot:
    -2: draw no box, no tick marks, no
    numeric tick labels, no axes. 
        -1: draw box only. 
        0: draw box, ticks, and numeric tick labels. 
        1: also draw coordinate axes at x=0 and y=0. 
        2: also draw a grid at major tick
    positions in both coordinates. 
        3: also draw a grid at minor tick
    positions in both coordinates. 
        10: same as 0 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        11: same as 1 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        12: same as 2 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        13: same as 3 except logarithmic x tick marks. (The x data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        20: same as 0 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        21: same as 1 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        22: same as 2 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        23: same as 3 except logarithmic y tick marks. (The y data
        have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        30: same as 0 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x
        and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        31: same as 1 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x
        and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        32: same as 2 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x
        and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.) 
        33: same as 3 except logarithmic x and y tick marks. (The x
        and y data have to be converted to logarithms separately.)
