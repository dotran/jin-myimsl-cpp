plclear: Clear current (sub)page 

DESCRIPTION:

    Clears the current page, effectively erasing everything that have been
    drawn.  This command only works with interactive drivers; if the
    driver does not support this, the page is filled with the background
    color in use. If the current page is divided into subpages, only the
    current subpage is erased.	The nth subpage can be selected with
    pladv(n). 

SYNOPSIS:
