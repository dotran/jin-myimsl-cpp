plsxax: Set x axis parameters 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets values of the digmax and digits flags for the x axis.	See the
    PLplot documentation for more information. 

SYNOPSIS:

plsxax(digmax, digits)

ARGUMENTS:

    digmax (PLINT, input) :    Variable to set the maximum number of
    digits for the x axis.    If nonzero, the printed label will be
    switched to a floating point representation when the number of
    digits exceeds digmax. 

    digits (PLINT, input) :    Field digits value.  Currently, changing
    its value here has no effect since it is set only by plbox or
    plbox3.  However, the user may obtain its value after a call to
    either of these functions by calling plgxax.
