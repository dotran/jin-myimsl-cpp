plinit: Initialize PLplot 

DESCRIPTION:

    Initializing the plotting package.	The program prompts for the device
    keyword or number of the desired output device.  Hitting a RETURN in
    response to the prompt is the same as selecting the first device. 
    plinit will issue no prompt if either the device was specified
    previously (via command line flag, the plsetopt function, or the
    plsdev function), or if only one device is enabled when PLplot is
    installed.	If subpages have been specified, the output device is
    divided into nx by ny subpages, each of which may be used
    independently.  If plinit is called again during a program, the
    previously opened file will be closed.  The subroutine pladv is used
    to advance from one subpage to the next. 

SYNOPSIS:

plinit()
