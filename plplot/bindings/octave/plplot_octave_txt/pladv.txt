pladv: Advance the (sub-)page

DESCRIPTION:

    Advances to the next subpage if sub=0, performing a page advance if
    there are no remaining subpages on the current page.  If subpages
    aren't being used, pladv(0) will always advance the page.  If sub>0,
    PLplot switches to the specified subpage.  Note that this allows you
    to overwrite a plot on the specified subpage; if this is not what you
    intended, use pleop followed by plbop to first advance the page.  This
    routine is called automatically (with sub=0) by plenv, but if plenv is
    not used, pladv must be called after initializing PLplot but before
    defining the viewport. 

SYNOPSIS:

pladv(sub)

ARGUMENTS:

    sub (PLINT, input) :    Specifies the subpage number (starting from 1
    in the top left corner and increasing along the rows) to which to
    advance.  Set to zero to advance to the next subpage.
