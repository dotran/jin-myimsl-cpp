plsori: Set orientation 

DESCRIPTION:

    Sets the current orientation.  If ori is equal to zero (default) then
    landscape is used (x axis is parallel to the longest edge of the
    page), otherwise portrait is used.	This option is not supported by
    all output drivers (in particular, most interactive screen drivers
    ignore the orientation).  This routine, if used, must be called before
    initializing PLplot. 

SYNOPSIS:

plsori(ori)

ARGUMENTS:

    ori (PLINT, input) :    Orientation value (0 for landscape, 1 for
    portrait; the value is multiplied by 90 degrees to get the angle)
