plstyl: Set line style 

DESCRIPTION:

    This sets up the line style for all lines subsequently drawn.  A line
    consists of segments in which the pen is alternately down and up. The
    lengths of these segments are passed in the arrays mark and space
    respectively.  The number of mark-space pairs is specified by nels. 
    In order to return the line style to the default continuous line,
    plstyl should be called with nels=0.(see also pllsty) 

SYNOPSIS:

plstyl(nels, mark, space)

ARGUMENTS:

    nels (PLINT, input) :    The number of mark and space elements in a
    line.  Thus a simple broken line can be obtained by setting
    nels=1.  A continuous line is specified by setting nels=0. 

    mark (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with the lengths of the
    segments during which the pen is down, measured in micrometers. 

    space (PLINT *, input) :    Pointer to array with the lengths of the
    segments during which the pen is up, measured in micrometers.
