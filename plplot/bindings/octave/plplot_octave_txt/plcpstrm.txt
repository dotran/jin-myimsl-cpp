plcpstrm: Copy state parameters from the
reference stream to the current stream 

DESCRIPTION:

    This function is used for making save files of selected plots (e.g.
    from the TK driver).  After initializing, you can get a copy of the
    current plot to the specified device by switching to this stream and
    issuing a plcpstrm and a plreplot, with calls to plbop and pleop as
    appropriate.  The plot buffer must have previously been enabled (done
    automatically by some display drivers, such as X). 

SYNOPSIS:

plcpstrm(iplsr, flags)

ARGUMENTS:

    iplsr (PLINT, input) :    Number of reference stream. 

    flags (PLINT, input) :    If flags is set to 1 the device coordinates
    are not copied from the reference to current stream.
