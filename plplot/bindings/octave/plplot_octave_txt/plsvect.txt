plsvect: Set arrow style for vector plots 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set the style for the arrow used by plvect to plot vectors. 

SYNOPSIS:

plsvect(arrowx, arrowy, npts, fill)

ARGUMENTS:

    arrowx, arrowy (PLFLT *,input) :    Pointers to a pair of arrays
    containing the x and y points which make up the arrow. The arrow
    is plotted by joining these points to form a polygon. The scaling
    assumes that the x and y points in the arrow lie in the range -0.5
    <= x,y <= 0.5. 

    npts (PLINT,input) :    Number of points in the arrays arrowx and
    arrowy. 

    fill (PLINT,input) :    If fill = 0 then the arrow is open, if fill =
    1 then the arrow is filled.
