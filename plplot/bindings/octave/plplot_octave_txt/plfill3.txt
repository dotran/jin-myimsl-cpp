plfill3: Draw filled polygon in 3D 

DESCRIPTION:

    Fills the 3D polygon defined by the n points in the x, y, and z arrays
    using the pattern defined by plpsty or plpat.  The routine will
    automatically close the polygon between the last and first vertices. 
    If multiple closed polygons are passed in x, y, and z then plfill3
    will fill in between them. 

SYNOPSIS:

plfill3(n, x, y, z)

ARGUMENTS:

    n (PLINT, input) :      Number of vertices in polygon. 

    x (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with x coordinates of
    vertices. 

    y (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with y coordinates of
    vertices. 

    z (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with z coordinates of
    vertices.
