plcont: Contour plot 

DESCRIPTION:

    Draws a contour plot of the data in z[
    nx][
    ny], using the nlevel contour levels specified by clevel. Only the
    region of the array from kx to lx and from ky to ly is plotted out.  A
    transformation routine pointed to by pltr with a pointer pltr_data for
    additional data required by the transformation routine is used to map
    indices within the array to the world coordinates.	See the following
    discussion of the arguments and the PLplot documentation for more
    information. 

SYNOPSIS:

plcont(z, nx, ny, kx, lx, ky, ly, clevel, nlevel, pltr, pltr_data)

ARGUMENTS:

    z (PLFLT **, input) :    Pointer to a vectored two-dimensional array
    containing data to be contoured. 

    nx, ny (PLINT, input) :    Physical dimensions of array z. 

    kx, lx (PLINT, input) :    Range of x indices to consider. 

    ky, ly (PLINT, input) :    Range of y indices to consider. 

    clevel (PLFLT *, input) :     Pointer to array specifying levels at
    which to draw contours. 

    nlevel (PLINT, input) :    Number of contour levels to draw. 

    pltr (void (*) (PLFLT, PLFLT, PLFLT *, PLFLT *, PLPointer) , input) : 
      Pointer to function that defines transformation between indices
    in array z and the world coordinates (C only).    Transformation
    functions are provided in the PLplot library: pltr0 for identity
    mapping, and pltr1 and pltr2 for arbitrary mappings respectively
    defined by one- and two-dimensional arrays.  In addition,
    user-supplied routines for the transformation can be used as well.
     Examples of all of these approaches are given in the PLplot
    documentation. The transformation function should have the form
    given by any of pltr0, pltr1, or pltr2. 

    pltr_data (PLPointer, input) :    Extra parameter to help pass
    information to pltr0, pltr1, pltr2, or whatever routine that is
    externally supplied.
