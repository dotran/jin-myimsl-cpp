plscol0:  Set a given color from color map0 by 8
bit RGB value 

DESCRIPTION:

    Set a given color by 8-bit RGB value for color map0 (see the PLplot
    documentation).  Overwrites the previous color value for the given
    index and, thus, does not result in any additional allocation of space
    for colors. 

SYNOPSIS:

plscol0(icol0, r, g, b)

ARGUMENTS:

    icol0 (PLINT, input) :    Color index.  Must be less than the maximum
    number of colors (which is set by default, by plscmap0n, or even
    by plscmap0). 

    r (PLINT, input) :      Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the
    degree of red in the color. 

    g (PLINT, input) :      Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the
    degree of green in the color. 

    b (PLINT, input) :      Unsigned 8-bit integer (0-255) representing the
    degree of blue in the color.
