plhist: Plot a histogram from unbinned data 

DESCRIPTION:

    Plots a histogram from n data points stored in the array data.  This
    routine bins the data into nbin bins equally spaced between datmin and
    datmax, and calls plbin to draw the resulting histogram.  Parameter
    oldwin allows the histogram either to be plotted in an existing window
    or causes plhist to call plenv with suitable limits before plotting
    the histogram. 

SYNOPSIS:

plhist(n, data, datmin, datmax, nbin, oldwin)

ARGUMENTS:

    n (PLINT, input) :      Number of data points. 

    data (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with values of the n data
    points. 

    datmin (PLFLT, input) :    Left-hand edge of lowest-valued bin. 

    datmax (PLFLT, input) :    Right-hand edge of highest-valued bin. 

    nbin (PLINT, input) :    Number of (equal-sized) bins into which to
    divide the interval xmin to xmax. 

    oldwin (PLINT, input) :    If one, the histogram is plotted in the
    currently-defined window, and if zero, plenv is called
    automatically before plotting.
