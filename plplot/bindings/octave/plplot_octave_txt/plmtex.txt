plmtex: Write text relative to viewport boundaries 

DESCRIPTION:

    Writes text at a specified position relative to the viewport
    boundaries.  Text may be written inside or outside the viewport, but
    is clipped at the subpage boundaries.  The reference point of a string
    lies along a line passing through the string at half the height of a
    capital letter.  The position of the reference point along this line
    is determined by just, and the position of the reference point
    relative to the viewport is set by disp and pos. 

SYNOPSIS:

plmtex(side, disp, pos, just, text)

ARGUMENTS:

    side (const char *, input) :    Specifies the side of the viewport
    along which the text is to be written. The string must be one of:
    b: Bottom of viewport, text written parallel to edge. 
        bv: Bottom of viewport, text written at right angles to edge. 
        l: Left of viewport, text written parallel to edge. 
        lv: Left of viewport, text written at right angles to edge. 
        r: Right of viewport, text written parallel to edge. 
        rv: Right of viewport, text written at right angles to edge. 
        t: Top of viewport, text written parallel to edge. 
        tv: Top of viewport, text written at right angles to edge. 


    disp (PLFLT, input) :    Position of the reference point of string,
    measured outwards from the specified viewport edge in units of the
    current character height.  Use negative disp to write within the
    viewport. 

    pos (PLFLT, input) :    Position of the reference point of string
    along the specified edge, expressed as a fraction of the length of
    the edge. 

    just (PLFLT, input) :    Specifies the position of the string relative
    to its reference point.  If just=0, the reference point is at the
    left and if just=1, it is at the right of the string.  Other
    values of just give intermediate justifications. 

    text (const char *, input) :    The string to be written out.
