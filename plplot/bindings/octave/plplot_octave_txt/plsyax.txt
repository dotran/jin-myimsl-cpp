plsyax: Set y axis parameters 

DESCRIPTION:

    Identical to plsxax, except that arguments are flags for y axis. See
    the description of plsxax for more detail. 

SYNOPSIS:

plsyax(digmax, digits)

ARGUMENTS:

    digmax (PLINT, input) :    Variable to set the maximum number of
    digits for the y axis.    If nonzero, the printed label will be
    switched to a floating point representation when the number of
    digits exceeds digmax. 

    digits (PLINT, input) :    Field digits value.  Currently, changing
    its value here has no effect since it is set only by plbox or
    plbox3.  However, the user may obtain its value after a call to
    either of these functions by calling plgyax.
