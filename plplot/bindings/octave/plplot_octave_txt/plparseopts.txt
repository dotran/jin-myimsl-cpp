DESCRIPTION:

    Parse command-line arguments. 

SYNOPSIS:

plparseopts(p_argc, argv, mode)

ARGUMENTS:

    p_argc (int *, input) :    pointer to number of arguments. 

    argv (char **, input) :    Pointer to character array containing
    *p_argc command-line arguments. 

    mode (PLINT, input) :    Parsing mode with the following
    possibilities:
    PL_PARSE_FULL (1) -- Full parsing of command line and all error
    messages
    enabled, including program exit when an error occurs.  Anything on the
    command line that isn't recognized as a valid option or option
    argument is
    flagged as an error.

        PL_PARSE_QUIET (2) -- Turns off all output except in the case
        of errors.

        PL_PARSE_NODELETE (4) -- Turns off deletion of processed
        arguments.

        PL_PARSE_SHOWALL (8) -- Show invisible options

        PL_PARSE_NOPROGRAM (32) -- Specified if argv[0] is NOT a
        pointer to the
    program name.

        PL_PARSE_NODASH (64) -- Set if leading dash is NOT required.

        PL_PARSE_SKIP (128) -- Set to quietly skip over any
        unrecognized args.
