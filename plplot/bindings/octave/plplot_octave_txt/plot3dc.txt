plot3dc: Magnitude colored plot surface with contour. 

DESCRIPTION:

    Identical to plot3d but with extra functionalities: the surface mesh
    can be colored accordingly to the current z value being plotted, a
    contour plot can be drawn at the base XY plane, and a curtain can be
    drawn between the plotted function border and the base XY plane. The
    arguments are identical to plmeshc. The only difference between
    plmeshc and plot3dc is that plmeshc draws the botton side of the
    surface, while plot3dc only draws the surface as viewed from the top. 

SYNOPSIS:

plot3dc(x, y, z, nx, ny, opt, clevel, nlevel)
