plbin: Plot a histogram from binned data 

DESCRIPTION:

    Plots a histogram consisting of nbin bins.	The value associated with
    the i'th bin is placed in x[i], and the number of points in the bin is
    placed in y[i].  For proper operation, the values in x[i] must form a
    strictly increasing sequence.  If center=0, x[i] is the left-hand edge
    of the i'th bin, and if center=1, the bin boundaries are placed midway
    between the values in the x array.	Also see plhist for drawing
    histograms from unbinned data. 

SYNOPSIS:

plbin(nbin, x, y, center)

ARGUMENTS:

    nbin (PLINT, input) :    Number of bins (i.e., number of values in x
    and y arrays.) 

    x (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array containing values associated
    with bins.  These must form a strictly increasing sequence. 

    y (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array containing number of points
    in bin.  This is a PLFLT (instead of PLINT) array so as to allow
    histograms of probabilities, etc. 

    center (PLINT, input) :    Indicates whether the values in x represent
    the lower bin boundaries (center=0) or whether the bin boundaries
    are to be midway between the x values (center=1).  If the values
    in x are equally spaced and center=1, the values in x are the
    center values of the bins.
