plfill: Draw filled polygon 

DESCRIPTION:

    Fills the polygon defined by the n points (
    x[i], 
    y[i]) using the pattern defined by plpsty or plpat.  The routine will
    automatically close the polygon between the last and first vertices. 
    If multiple closed polygons are passed in x and y then plfill will
    fill in between them. 

SYNOPSIS:

plfill(n, x, y)

ARGUMENTS:

    n (PLINT, input) :      Number of vertices in polygon. 

    x (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with x coordinates of
    vertices. 

    y (PLFLT *, input) :    Pointer to array with y coordinates of
    vertices.
