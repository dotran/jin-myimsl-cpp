Excerpts from the package README:
	
	Have you ever wanted to call subroutines from a C library from a
	scripting language like MATLAB or octave or tela?  Have you ever wanted
	to write your own simulation in C and have its functions be directly
	callable from MATLAB, instead of going through output files?  It is very
	tedious and error-prone to write the wrapper functions which convert
	from MATLAB's types to the float or double or int types that your
	functions actually want. matwrap is a perl script that generates the
	wrapper functions for you automatically from your .h files.

   [...]
	
	matwrap currently supports the languages Matlab (version 5.0), octave,
   and tela.  Other languages can be added with a little bit of work.
