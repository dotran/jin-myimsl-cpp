Installation instructions for the win32/msdev port of plplot
============================================================

1. Introduction

This file contains information on how to compile and run the
plplot library using MS Visual C++ on PCs running MS Windows
98/NT/2000/XP (the current distribution has not been tested on
Windows 95 however it should normally work on this version of
Windows as well.)

Please note that the work on the win32/msdev port is well
advanced, but not finished yet. These instructions will tell
you how to build the plplot.lib and plplotd.dll libraries and
all the C examples except x14c and x17c.

For more information about the win32/msdev port
of plplot please see plplot/sys/win32/msdev/README.TXT.


2. Requirements

You'll need MS Visual C++ version 5, 6 or higher for building
plplot. You might be able to use an earlier version of Visual C++
but you will probably not be able to use the provided makfiles.
You will also need to make sure that you can execute the "nmake"
command on a MS-DOS prompt command line.


3. Source files

You can extract the sources of plplot in any directory you want.


4. Compilation

  4.1 Open a MS-DOS prompt window.
  4.2 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev
  4.3 Type "nmake". The files needed for the compilation of
      plplot will be copied to plplot\tmp.
  4.4 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev\plplib.
  4.5 Type "nmake plplib.mak". The plplot.lib library will
      be built and placed in the same directory.
  4.6 Change directory to plplot\sys\win32\msdev\Examples.
  4.7 Type "nmake Examples.mak". All C examples will be
      built except x14c and x17c in the plplot/tmp
      directory. (For comments about the examples see
      plplot\sys\win32\msdev\README.TXT.)


5. Running plplot

You can run the C examples directly from plplot\tmp. However,
if you would like to run your programs in a different directory
you have to make sure that plplot can find the font files
(located in plplot/lib with the extension .fnt):

  5.1 Set the environment variable PLPLOT_HOME to point to
      where you have installed plplot, e.g.
        SET PLPLOT_HOME="C:\PLPLOT"
      (see plplot\FAQ number 1.12)
  5.2 or simply make sure that the font files are in the same
      directory where you execute your plplot program.


6. Building and using the DLL

You must compile with the flag __PLDLL_H__ defined.
This is necessary to select the correct prototypes.
It is unfortunate, but there is - currently - no transparant
way to achieve this.

Some more remarks (running the examples):
- If an example program can not find the PLplot DLL at run-time,
  it may display a message box saying so, or it may simply stop without
  any output. The latter happens if you start it in a DOS-box (at least
  that is the case on my computer, running Windows XP).
- If the example program can not find the font files, it will stop
  after you have selected a device. It will probably display a message
  to that effect, but unless you run it in a DOS-box, the message will
  disappear very quickly.


7. Building and using PLplot for Java on Windows

(Information kindly supplied by Ali Mohammed)

I used the following steps to compile a jni enabled dll on windows

Pre-requisite:
1. Microsoft Visual C compiler version 12.00. It is part of Visual Studio 6.
2. nmake.exe utility. It is downloadable from microsoft.com

Steps:

  7.1. download the latest tarball from the following link
       http://plplot.sourceforge.net/cvs-tarball/

  7.2. Use winzip to expand the compressed tar file to the C drive.
       On my machine I have it installed under c:\plplot

  7.3. open "c:\plplot\src\plcore.c" file in a text editor.
       search for "getcwd()" and change it to "_getcwd()".
       save the file.

  7.4. Open up a dos shell in windows. Go to the following folder
       c:\plplot\sys\win32\msdev
       type "nmake" and press enter. (Assuming nmake is defined in the
       system path)

  7.5. Within dos shell go to the following folder
       c:\plplot\sys\win32\msdev\plplib
       type "nmake plplib.mak" and press enter

  7.6. make a folder "core" under c:\plplot
       create a text file in this folder with the name "run.bat"
       Type in following in this file.

       set JAVA_HOME=C:\j2sdk1.4.2_01
       cl /I%JAVA_HOME%\include /I%JAVA_HOME%\include\win32 /Id:\plplot\include /LD c:/plplot/bindings/java/plplotjavac_wrap.c /Fejplplot.dll /link c:\plplot\sys\win32\msdev\plplib\plplot.lib /NOD USER32.lib GDI32.lib KERNEL32.LIB MSVCRT.LIB

      make appropriate changes based on your system environment
      Run this batch file from command prompt.

On successful completion of all the above steps you will have jplplot.dll in
"c:\plplot\core" folder.

Any java application using plplot APIs should load this dll first.
e.g.,
static {
    System.load("jplplot.dll");
}

If you have any questions or difficulty, please feel free to email me.

8. Building and using it under MicroSoft's .NET

PLplot, version 5.3.1, can be built and used in MicroSoft's .NET
environment, if you use the C++ or C bindings. Previous versions
used an obsolete keyword which the C compiler under .NET complained
about.

Note:
It appears that the C/C++ compiler in .NET2003 has an optimisation
bug/quirk which can make contour and shade drawings look bad. This means
that you have to turn off the optimisation for this compiler (by default
it is turned on in the PLplot makefile!)


9. Some build details

Because the build environment on Windows is completely different than
the one on Linux and UNIX, it is not possible to configure the build
process as smoothly as under Linux/UNIX. In particular, the options
in the header file "plconfig.h" are fixed in the file "makefile" in
"sys\win32\msdev".


10. Comments & suggestions

If you have comments or suggestions on how to improve the
win32/msdev port of plplot please dont't hesitate to contact
me via email.
