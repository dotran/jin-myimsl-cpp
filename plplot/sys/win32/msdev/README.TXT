README file for the win32/msdev port of plplot
==============================================

Belongs to PLplot version: 5.3.1
Information updated:       january 2004

I will here give some background information, information
on current status and future developments of the win32/msdev
port of plplot. For installation instructions please see the
plplot\sys\win32\msdev\INSTALL.TXT.

The win32\msdev port of plplot were originally written by
Paul Casteels (casteels@uia.ua.ac.be) and Carla Carmelo Rosa
(l36658@alfa.ist.utl.pt). However, Paul and Carla have not
done any new developments since 1996. I managed to pick up
their code and make it work under 98/NT/2000. My colleague
Alexandre Gobbo (gobbo@esrf.fr) has provided very valuable
help in this work. Even though we had to make substantial
changes of their code it is essentially the same so the credit
of the win32/msdev port of plplot in general and the win3
driver in particular should go as much to Paul and Carla as
to Alexandre and me.

Please note that the work on the win32/msdev port is under
progress. The plplot distribution contains makefiles for
making the plplot.lib library and the c examples, however
the work on the plplot.dll is not yet finished. All C
examples compile and run except x14c (which needs TCL) and
x17c (problem with refreshments of the plot). x20c, which
demonstrates the new function plimage, works but is rather
slow (see below).

Here's a list of (known!) missing features from the win3
device:

* Only cursor movements are reported back via the plGetCursor
  function, not any key strokes.
* It is not a fast plimage device, however the work on
  making it one is well advanced.

If you notice more missing features or bugs in the win32/msdev
port of plplot please let me know.

I hope to be able to finish the work on the plplot.dll and
the fast plimage soon.

If you have comments or suggestions on how to improve the
win32/msdev port of plplot please dont't hesitate to contact
me via email.
