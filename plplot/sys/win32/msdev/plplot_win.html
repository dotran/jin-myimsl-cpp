<h1>Overview</h1>
<p>PLplot is a library of C functions that are useful for making
scientific plots from a program written in a number of languages:
</p>
<ul>
<li>Compiled languages like: C, C++, Fortran and Java
<li>Scripting (or dynamic) languages: Octave, Python and Tcl
</ul>
<p>
The PLplot library can be used to create standard x-y plots,
semilog plots, log-log plots, contour plots, 3D plots, mesh plots,
bar charts and pie charts. Multiple graphs (of the same or
different sizes) may be placed on a single page with
multiple lines in each graph.
</p><p>
There are almost 2000 characters in the extended character set.
This includes four different fonts, the Greek alphabet and a host of
mathematical, musical, and other symbols.
</p><p>
A variety of output devices are supported and new devices can be
easily added by writing a small number of device dependent routines.
