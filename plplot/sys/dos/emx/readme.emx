Introduction
------------

Welcome to emx 0.9a, an environment for creating 32-bit programs for
OS/2 2.x and DOS.  You can use the GNU C compiler to compile programs
for emx.  The main design goal of emx is to simplify porting Unix
software to OS/2 2.x and DOS.  Moreover, you can create `native' OS/2
programs, including Presentation Manager applications.

The emx package includes:

- emx.dll, emxio.dll, emxwrap.dll and emxlibc.dll dynamic link
  libraries for OS/2 2.x

- emx.exe DOS extender for running 32-bit programs under DOS

- emxfpemu, W. Metzenthen's FPU (387) emulator

- emxbind.exe for creating .exe files which work both under OS/2 2.x
  and DOS

- emxomf.exe for converting .o object files (a.out) to .obj object
  files (OMF).  With emxomf and LINK386 you can create OS/2 programs
  that don't need emx.dll

- emximp.exe for creating import libraries

- emxexp.exe for creating a list of export definitions from object files

- C header files and a complete C library

- a simple graphics library for 320x200 (256 colors) mode

- a library for screen output in windows

- header files and a library for using sockets of IBM TCP/IP for OS/2

Additionally, the following GNU programs are available compiled and with
patches and sources:

- GCC 2.6.3, the GNU C compiler, supporting the C, C++, and Objective
  C language

- GAS 2.3, the GNU assembler

- GDB 4.13, the GNU debugger

- ld, the GNU linker

- ar, nm, size, strip, objdump: some GNU utilities for dealing with
  binary files

- texinfo, the GNU documentation system

- Patches for the GNU sources

- Patched source for GCC, GAS, GDB, ld, ar, nm, size, strip, objdump,
  info, makeinfo, texindex.  You can compile all these programs with
  the files that come with emx (but you also need a make utility, such
  as dmake).

You can get the complete unpatched GNU sources by anonymous ftp from
prep.ai.mit.edu and other archives, for instance ftp.uni-stuttgart.de.

Additionally, the following libraries are provided:

- some parts of the BSD C library

- BSD curses library

- Henry Spencer's regexp library

Where to get emx
----------------

emx is available for anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.18.15]: /pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9a
  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]:  /os2/32bit/unix/emx09a
  src.doc.ic.ac.uk     [146.169.2.1]:  /packages/os2/32bit/unix/emx09a
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]:
                                       /pub/comp/os/os2/devtools/emx+gcc

Other files of interest
-----------------------

emx does not come with a `make' utility.  I recommend dmake 3.8.  It's
available for anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.18.15]: /pub/systems/os2/programming/support/
  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]:  /os2/all/program/
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]:
                                       /pub/comp/os/os2/devtools/

Executables are in dmake38x.zip, source code is in dmake38s.zip.
dmake38.zip contains both dmake38s.zip and dmake38x.zip.

The emx graphics library currently supports only the 320x200 VGA mode
and some 16-color modes.  Johannes Martin has created a graphics
library for various SVGA cards.  It is available for anonymous ftp on

  ftp.uni-stuttgart.de [129.69.18.15]: /pub/systems/os2/emx-0.9a/contrib/
  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]:  /os2/32bit/unix/emx09a/contrib/
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]:
                                       /pub/comp/os/os2/gnu/emx+gcc/contrib/

You need svgakt*.zip (or svgakit*.zip) and vesa*.zip (or
vesa_emx*.zip, * is the version number).

If you want to convert the texinfo files (GCC documentation, for
instance) to OS/2 on-line books (.inf files), I recommend Andreas
Kaiser's texi2ipf program:

  ftp-os2.cdrom.com:  [192.153.46.2]: /os2/32bit/unix/tex/txi2ipf1.zip
  ftp.informatik.tu-muenchen.de [131.159.0.198]:
                                      /pub/comp/os/os2/gnu/doc/txi2ipf1.zip
