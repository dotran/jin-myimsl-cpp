Installation Instructions for DOS

This latest version of the PLPLOT package incorporates numerous enhancements
to the prior version.  The package is designed to use MS C 6 for the C compiler 
and MS Fortran 5 for the Fortran compiler.  The makefile will build the 
package once you have your environment set up correctly.  The accompanying
plconfig.cmd shows how I have my system set up.	You will need to adjust the
paths and etc to match your own system configuration.

Note:  I use OS/2 as my software development environement, even when targetting
for DOS.  If you wish to build directly under DOS, rename plconfig.cmd to
plconfig.bat, edit the path settings, and proceed from there.  

Once these matters are resolved, build the package via:
	nmake links
	nmake
	nmake fonts
	nmake demos
	
You can set PLFONTS=dir to get plplot to recognize wherever you decide
to keep your fonts.  \lib seems like a logical choice on my system.

If you don't have a suitable make facility, get one.  There are good public
domain make utilities, in addition to Microsoft's NMAKE which I use.  If you
have used older NMAKE's, don't despair, the one that ships with MS C 6.0
actually works quite well.

Alternativley, this directory contains a file plmake.bat and associated 
lib response files which were used in earlier versions of PLPLOT.  These are
not up to date, as I don't use them anymore, but they should serve as a
good example of how to go about building PLPLOT without a make facility.
If you update the plmake.bat file, send it to me and I'll include it in the
distribution.
