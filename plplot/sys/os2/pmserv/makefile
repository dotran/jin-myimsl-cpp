	@echo * set up the right path in the beginning of this makefile
	@echo * copy the makefile in a subdir of the current one (i.e. you are in '../os2/pmserv', make a 'tmp') 
	@echo * type 'make links' in the subdir to copy the files you need
	@echo * type 'make pmserv' to make the PMServer for PLPLOT
	@echo * (mybe you have to 'set include=/emx09b/include' to get it right)
	@echo * continue making the PLPLOT-part of this contribution
