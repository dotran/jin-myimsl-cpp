# This Makefile should not be used in the build tree.  It is meant for use
# only in the install tree.  It is first configured, then installed 
# (with the name Makefile) in the _installed_ examples directory as a 
# convenience to the user for building all the examples without having 
# to invoke make in the individual sub-directories of examples.
