# This is called from plplot-test.sh with $javadir, $device, $dsuffix,
# and $options defined.
# N.B. $PLPLOT_CLASSPATH must be defined properly so it includes a 
# reference to plplot.jar. If not we assume in installation location.
# The path must point to the java command for this to work. 

# To build the java examples before running this script do the following:
# pushd $javadir; make; popd

# Do the standard non-interactive examples.
# skip 14 because it requires two output files.
# skip 19 because it is not implemented
# skip 17, and 20 because they are interactive and not implemented.
# skip 21 because it delivers variable results depending on computer timing
# and load and is not implemented.
#
# Set up option to point to java bindings jar file and wrapper if needed.
