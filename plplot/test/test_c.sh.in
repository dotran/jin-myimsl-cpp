# This is called from plplot-test.sh with $cdir, $device, $dsuffix,
# and $options defined.

# To build the c examples before running this script do the following:
# pushd $cdir; make; popd

# Do the standard non-interactive examples.
# skip 14 because it requires two output files.
# skip 17 and 20 because they are interactive.
# skip 21 because it delivers variable results depending on computer timing
# and load.
