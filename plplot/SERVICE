	In other words, you fly me to wherever your company or lab is
	located, and I'll teach as many people as you can pack in a room.

I am also willing to do contract work not related to PLplot.
Experienced with parallel programming (MPI, dataparallel--can do PVM,
but double the rate below :-), C++, X, Tcl/Tk/Itcl, Perl, etc.
