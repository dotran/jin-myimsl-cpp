dnl In a reversal of previous practice, I print the actual variables
dnl in the configure log.  This is to remind the user of the
dnl difference between the command line syntax (which you can always
dnl get help on by issuing a --help option) and the internal
dnl representation.  It's necessary to remember this for when you want
dnl to set the variable directly via ~/config/cf_plplot.in.

dnl The following command is done in two parts to allow AIX 5.2 shell to
dnl parse it.
